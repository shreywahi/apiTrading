- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Security Considerations

- API credentials are never stored permanently
- All API requests are made directly from your browser to Binance
- The application only requests read-only permissions
- No trading functionality is implemented for security

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid API Key" Error**:
   - Verify your API key is copied correctly
   - Ensure the API key is active in your Binance account

2. **"Invalid Signature" Error**:
   - Check that your API secret is entered correctly
   - Make sure your system time is synchronized

3. **"Network Error" or CORS Issues**:
   - **This is the most common issue in browser-based applications**
   - CORS errors occur when browsers block direct API calls to external domains
   - **Quick Solution**: Visit [CORS Anywhere Demo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and enable temporary access
   - **Alternative**: Use Binance Testnet (requires testnet API keys)
   - **Production**: Deploy with a backend server that proxies API calls

4. **"IP Restricted" Error**:
   - Check if you've restricted the API key to specific IP addresses
   - Add your current IP address to the whitelist in Binance

5. **Loading Issues**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that Binance API is accessible from your location

### Browser Compatibility

This application works best with modern browsers:
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issues

When running this application in a browser, you may encounter CORS errors because browsers block direct API calls to external domains for security reasons.

#### Quick Fix for Development:
1. Visit [CORS Anywhere Demo](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo)
2. Click "Request temporary access to the demo server"
3. Return to the application and try connecting again

#### Alternative Solutions:
- **Binance Testnet**: Use testnet API keys with `https://testnet.binance.vision`
- **Local Proxy**: Set up a local server to proxy API requests
- **Browser Extension**: Use CORS-disabling extensions (not recommended)
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy with a backend server

#### For Production Use:
Create a backend API that proxies requests to Binance, avoiding CORS issues entirely.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
